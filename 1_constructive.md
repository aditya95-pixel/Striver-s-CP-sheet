### 1.Bit++

The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.

The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called x. Also, there are two operations:

Operation ++ increases the value of variable x by 1.
Operation -- decreases the value of variable x by 1.
A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable x. The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters "+", "-", "X". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.

A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.

You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of x is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.

Next n lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable x (denoted as letter «X»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.

Output
Print a single integer — the final value of x.

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    int x=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        string op;
        cin>>op;
        if((op[0]=='X' && op[1]=='+') || op[0]=='+')
        x++;
        else
        x--;
    }
    cout<<x<<endl;
}
```

### 2. Chewbaсca and Number

Luke Skywalker gave Chewbacca an integer number x. Chewbacca isn't good at numbers but he loves inverting digits in them. Inverting digit t means replacing it with digit 9 - t.

Help Chewbacca to transform the initial number x to the minimum possible positive number by inverting some (possibly, zero) digits. The decimal representation of the final number shouldn't start with a zero.

Input
The first line contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1018) — the number that Luke Skywalker gave to Chewbacca.

Output
Print the minimum possible positive number that Chewbacca can obtain after inverting some digits. The number shouldn't contain leading zeroes.

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    string x,x1;
    cin>>x;
    for(int i=0;i<x.size();i++){
        int dig=x[i]-'0';
        if(dig==9 && i==0)
        {
            x1+=(dig+'0');
            continue;
        }
        if(dig>9-dig){
            x1+=(9-dig+'0');
        }else{
            x1+=(dig+'0');
        }
    }
    cout<<x1<<endl;
}
```

### 3. Beautiful Matrix

You've got a 5 × 5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one. Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's index the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the matrix:

Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes i and i + 1 for some integer i (1 ≤ i < 5).
Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes j and j + 1 for some integer j (1 ≤ j < 5).
You think that a matrix looks beautiful, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

Input
The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers: the j-th integer in the i-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.

Output
Print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int x,y;
    for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<5;j++){
            char c;
            cin>>c;
            if(c=='1'){
                x=i;
                y=j;
            }
        }
    }
    cout<<(abs(x-2)+abs(y-2))<<endl;
}
```

### 4. Soft Drinking

This winter is so cold in Nvodsk! A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called "Take-It-Light" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.

To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?

Input
The first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

Output
Print a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n,k,l,c,d,p,nl,np;
    cin>>n>>k>>l>>c>>d>>p>>nl>>np;
    cout<<min({k*l/nl,c*d,p/np})/n;
}
```

### 5. The New Year: Meeting Friends

There are three friend living on the straight line Ox in Lineland. The first friend lives at the point x1, the second friend lives at the point x2, and the third friend lives at the point x3. They plan to celebrate the New Year together, so they need to meet at one point. What is the minimum total distance they have to travel in order to meet at some point and celebrate the New Year?

It's guaranteed that the optimal answer is always integer.

Input
The first line of the input contains three distinct integers x1, x2 and x3 (1 ≤ x1, x2, x3 ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the houses of the first, the second and the third friends respectively.

Output
Print one integer — the minimum total distance the friends need to travel in order to meet together.

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    vector<int>x(3);
    for(auto &i:x)
    cin>>i;
    sort(x.begin(),x.end());
    int dist=0;
    for(auto ele:x)
    dist+=abs(ele-x[1]);
    cout<<dist<<endl;
}
```

### 6. Sum of Round Numbers

A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called round if it is of the form d00...0. In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from 1
 to 9
 (inclusive) are round.

For example, the following numbers are round: 4000
, 1
, 9
, 800
, 90
. The following numbers are not round: 110
, 707
, 222
, 1001
.

You are given a positive integer n
 (1≤n≤104
). Represent the number n
 as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number n
 as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.

Input
The first line contains an integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t
 test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing an integer n
 (1≤n≤104
).

Output
Print t
 answers to the test cases. Each answer must begin with an integer k
 — the minimum number of summands. Next, k
 terms must follow, each of which is a round number, and their sum is n
. The terms can be printed in any order. If there are several answers, print any of them.

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int n;
        cin>>n;
        int k=0;
        vector<int>addends;
        int zc=1;
        while(n>0){
            int dig=n%10;
            if(dig!=0)
            {k++;addends.push_back(dig*zc);}
            n/=10;
            zc*=10;
        }
        cout<<k<<endl;
        for(auto ele:addends)
        cout<<ele<<" ";
        cout<<endl;
    }
}
```
